    <h1>Welcome to Robin's Component Library</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Robin Hooda</strong> is attending neog.camp and is currently completing levelZero one weekend and
        assignment at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a component library created by her to better design each element.
    </p>
    <p>
        After creating this library, I am going to use the components in my <strong>portfolio, blog and all
            projects</strong> created.
        This will ensure that all my projects have <strong>consistent themeing and styling.</strong>
    </p>
